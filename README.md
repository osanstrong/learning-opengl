# Cursed OpenGL Testbed

A really quick and messy testbed to simultaneously get the hang of developing in c++ and using openGL in preparation for planned Radiance Cascades project.

Broken into subprojects:
- FirstSteps: getting feet wet, making sure we can actually import opengl libraries properly
- SecondSteps: More linearly following an opengl tutorial to load and render a texture, then handle with framebuffers.
